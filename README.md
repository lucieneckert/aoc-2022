**Advent of Code 2022, in Rust.**

Got a pretty late start here due to the end-of-semester final project crunch, but I'm aiming to see how far I get solving Advent of Code puzzles using just Rust.
I've typically used Python (and did a quarter of one year in C++), and don't have much Rust experience, so I'm expecting this to be a bit of a trial by fire.
